1. "main.py": This file will be the entry point of the application. It will use functions from "file_ingestion.py", "database_handler.py", "query_handler.py", and "code_generator.py". It will also use the models defined in "models.py".

2. "database_handler.py": This file will contain functions for interacting with the database. It will use the models defined in "models.py" and may use utility functions from "utils.py".

3. "file_ingestion.py": This file will contain functions for reading the text file and splitting it into chunks. It may use utility functions from "utils.py".

4. "query_handler.py": This file will contain functions for querying the codebase. It will use the models defined in "models.py" and may use utility functions from "utils.py".

5. "code_generator.py": This file will contain functions for generating code from the codebase. It will use the models defined in "models.py" and may use utility functions from "utils.py".

6. "models.py": This file will define the data schemas used in the application. These schemas will be used by "database_handler.py", "query_handler.py", and "code_generator.py".

7. "utils.py": This file will contain utility functions that may be used by any of the other files.

Shared Dependencies:
